# Neural-network-for-extreme-value-copula
This repository contains the complete Python code and analysis pipeline for the paper. The project introduces and validates a novel semi-parametric methodology for estimating the Pickands dependence function of bivariate extreme value copulas using a purpose-built neural network.
